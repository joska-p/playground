Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save to `./_TEMP/handoff/`.

Include a "suggested skills" section naming which skills the next agent should call.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path instead.

Redact any sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII).

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
